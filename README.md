Test your Problem Solving and try to get a better time.

Create a google sheet online or use with .csv offline with the following schema:

| Problem Description | Test Cases | Time | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem 1 | Test case 1 | 20 |
| Problem 2 | Test case 2 | 15 | 


**To load your live google sheet online:**<br/>
Change import_online to True, and replace ___online_url___ with that part of your url.<br/><br/>
**To load your offline .csv:**<br/>
Download your Problems as .csv (only downloading selected collumns and rows)<br/>
And name the document 'Problems.csv' and place in the same folder.<br/><br/>
**How to Use:**
- Run in Jupyter Notebook and execute this program and your answer in seperate code block
- Or if using an IDE run this program parallel (as opposed to on the same script as your answer)
- Use the command done() to see how your time compared to your best
